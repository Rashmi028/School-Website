<center>I feel fortunate to be part of St. Karen's where education is used as
<center>powerful tool to shape the world. The purpose of Education is
<center>achieved when knowledge is used to serve mankind. when there
<center>is an explosion of information, it is up to us to discern and convert
<center>that information in to knowledge and further use that knowledge to
<center>make choice that are right, will have an impact on our environment.
<center>If we as citizens can exercise this knowledge with responsibility,it
<center>would b wisdom in action and the world would be happier place
<center>to live in.
