<center>It is with an abiding sense of satisfaction and pride that I see the year
<center>2016-17 and the jubilee celebration drawing to a most satisfying close.
<center>The 'season of change' continued with renewed vigour across the entire
<center>spectrum of activities at SKSS during this year. To provide focus and stay
<center>on the charted course that we had identified,our managment,teachers,
<center>staff,parents and students left no stone unturned and at SKSS looks back
<center>at the manner in which the year turned out, there is much to be proud of.
<center>The monumental strides that SKSS had undertaken and the ready enthusiasm 
<center>with which our students adapted themselves to the changes they encountered
<center>are admirable in every respect.
<center>The concluding celebration of the jubilee year will forever remain on especially
<center>historic moment in the annals of this institution. The 'Alisa and the Magic Atlas' is a
<center>milestone event for SKSS. Keeping our vision in mind we have been working with commitment
<center>and dedication and trying to instill in our students qualities like respect for others,compassion,
<center>patriotism, strong sense of self belief and confidence and empower them to positively contribute
<center>to society and become active responsible citizens of the country.
<center>I take this opportunity on this occassion to convey my appreciation to all
<center>the stake holders for contributing generously and steadfastly in bringing this institution
<center>to its present level of excellence and glory
<center>I pray that the almighty god mat shower his choicect blessings on the entire St. Karen's Family.
