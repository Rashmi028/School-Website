<CENTER>Today St. Karen's Secondary School prides itself in celebrating its Silver Jubilee;
<center>twenty-five years since its inception. It is a milestone of an event  in the annals
<center>of this school. As its co-founder in reminiscence a nostalgic wave of memories 
<center>sweeep in mind.
<center>25 years ago a vacant house on Bailey Road,Patna, of one Mr. B.N.Chaudhary,I.A.S.
<center>attracted my attention as I drove past in my black Ambasador car. It drew my attention
<center>with an inspiration to rent it for the inception of St. Karen's Secondary School. With the 
<center>academic assistance of my wife Lesley Barbara Gaulstaun and my eldest daughter Karen, we
<center>dropped anchor at this bay to sow the seed of the Montessori wing, which within a short
<center>span of a quarter of a century has now grown into a giant, towering oak; blooming fully,
<center>and making resonating waves of recognisation and gaining much applause.
<center>Its gradual climb from a mere Montessori School, to a Secondary School and then its final
<center>ascent to the Higher Secondary level was never a bed of roses. There were plenty of thorns
<center>and thistles along the way;making it a near Calvary at times. Having endured the repeated
<center>setbacks and gailing moments of dissapointments and daunting strictures and stipulatons
<center>has been a herculean task . However, now, successfully having come through the tunnels of
<center>ordels in the labyrinth of its growth makes St. karen's Secondary School's stance a historic 
<center> one today.
<center>It stands magnificently poised liked a lighthouse, offering the youth not just a Safe-Beacon of
<center>pursuit of education, but a plethora of light of knowledge of an incandescent nature assuring
<center>its students a very wholesome holistic education manning them efficently well to combat the 
<center>challenges and not only to triumph but to etch for themselves a prominent place in the sun of
<center>Glory.
<center>In short;"To Shine To Outshine."
<center>I take the opportunity on this august occassion to convey my regards and salutations to the
<center>Principals,present and past,the Teachers,Students and Staff for contributing generouslt,
<center>gallantly, and steadfastly,respectively in their various fields the rich glories of which we are
<center>harvesting today. 
<center>Indeed the historic events, and the tide of events with the passage of time have created for the 
<center>school a memorable tapestry for its alumni and posterity........."Silver threads among the Gold!!!!"
<center>And so,moving on from here, into a new era, we are confident that St. karen's Secondary School,
<center>building upon its varied experiences and acme achievements they'll blaze the trail elegantly
<center>transforming it into:-
<center>"SILVER THREADS AMONG THE GOLD."
<center>AFFECTIONATELY
<CENTER>D.P. GALSTAUN
