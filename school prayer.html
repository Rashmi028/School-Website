<center>From the crown of my head to the soles of my feet;
<center>I give to you Lord my being complete,
<center>For guidance and wisdom throughout this day,
<center>Every step that I take, very word that I say,
<center>Cause me to meet the ones I should see,
<center>Help me to speak the words that I say.
<center>Keep me from folks whoever they be;
<center>Unless I can help them or they can help me.
<center>Help me treat others as I'd had treat me.
<center>And as I forgive others dear Lord forgive me.
<center>Temper each word and act with the love.
<center>And give me the wisdom that comes from above.
<center>I thank thee dear God for life, home and love.
<center>For food,raiment and loving Parents' gifts from above.
<center>For your guidance and grace to save me from sin
<center>For life everlasting through your Holy name.
